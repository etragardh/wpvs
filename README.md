# wpvs
WordPress Vulnerability Scanner

```
./wpvs
./wpvs --age 10 (10 days old or newer)
./wpvs --cvss-min 9 --age 5 --type RCE
./wpvs --debug
```


First run takes some time since a lot of requests is sent. Everything is cached and searches are 100% local if possible.<br />
<br />
This tool is for searching vulnerability datebases. Not for scanning a website.
<br />
Stay nice!
